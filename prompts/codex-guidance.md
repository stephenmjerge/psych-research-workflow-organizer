# Codex Guidance

- Favor portable bash/python scripts so automations run across all project repos without extra setup.
- When touching shared templates, update references in `docs/PortfolioHub.md` and `meta/MASTER_TIMELINE.md` if the workflow changes.
- Keep secrets out of the repo; reference environment variables documented in `DATA_SECURITY.md` instead.
- Note every automation tweak in `CHANGELOG.md` so weekly review prep is painless.
