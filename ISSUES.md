# Issues

Use this file as the intake form for ops or automation gaps. For every issue, capture:

- The repo(s) or documents affected.
- Current manual steps vs. proposed automation.
- Deadlines tied to review cadences (weekly review, ethics sync, etc.).

High-priority operations work should also be listed inside `meta/launchpad/project-priorities.md`.

## Issue: Cross-repo update checklist
- Source: `meta/launchpad/project-priorities.md` (Workflow Organizer secondary focus)
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Document a repeatable checklist covering `meta/launchpad`, PortfolioHub, and repo README/ROADMAP sync.
  - Note responsible owners + cadence so the workflow can be delegated later.
  - Reference the checklist from the roadmap + README so it is discoverable.
- Status: Completed (Nov 13, 2025).
